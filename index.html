  <h2>So, What Really is Fast Fashion?</h2>
  <p>According to goodonyou.eco, fast fashion, "can be defined as cheap, trendy clothing, that samples ideas from the catwalk or celebrity culture and turns them into garments in high street stores at breakneck speed to meet consumer demand." The whole practice is based around trends and whatever becomes out of style. Even if it is only after a few wears, it is no longer relevant. The garments produced using fast fashion are also extremely likely to be low quality, causing them to wear out, tear, or rip easily.</p>
<h2>What Are the Economics Behind It?</h2>
<p>Reducing costs to speed up production time and produce the newest and trendiest clothing in the blink of an eye is how fast fashion makes its money. </p>
<h2>What are the Environmental Impacts?</h2>
<p>Fast fashion uses cheap and toxic textile dyes, which make the clothing industry the second larget water polluter globally. Textiles such as polyester derive from fossil fuels and contribute to global warming. Leather processing also has a large impact involving the amount of chemicals being added. The even larger picture, however, is that because of this fast-paced supply and demand, clothes are thrown out constantly, creating enormous amounts of textile waste that end up in landfills. </p>
<h2>Human Rights Violations</h2>
<p>Along with the supply and demand, workers in the factories for fast fashion companies are treated extremely poorly. Low wages, being underpaid, underfed, harassment, dangerous equipment, child labor, medical issues, and more, all contribute to how these workers are treated by these multi-billion dollar companies. Many chemicals and toxins are released when producing these garments, and it is extremely detrimental to the workers who make them. Benzothiazole for example, is linked to cancer and respiratory illness, and it's found on many apparel that we wear. Many workers are women and young girls who make as little as 15 cents per hour in some areas. </p>
